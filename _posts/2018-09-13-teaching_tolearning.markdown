I chose to become a teacher because I wanted to help shape the future and paired that desire with my love of kids to work directly with the world's future adults. I still have that same desire, however, I wanted to make an impact on the education world in a different way. So why web developing? 

* At almost every campus or facility that I've worked with, I've been known to be the "young tech person" that is called by other teachers who have a problem with their computers or can't figure out how to work a program. Honestly, most of the time it was just helping them find a button on a webpage, restarting their computer, or even just plugging in a loose cord. Lame reason? Maybe. **But enough for me to want to fix problems** that went beyond the simple in a computer. A part of me wanted to be the "tech person" they called when I couldn't figure it out -when things went beyond the physical and into the digital.

* Yet, what really sparked my interest in web developing was that, as a teacher, I’ve seen many different apps and websites being used and have wished multiple times for “an easier way.” I’ve seen teachers complain about they have to navigate through so many different websites or apps and about how much time they’ve wasted on these instead of actually being able to teach. I’ve seen teachers wish for an app for certain types of lessons or even wish certain functions could be added to these apps. 

* As I'm writing this blog, I've come to the realization that working with kids has strangely sparked a a coding desire in me. Maybe, its the constant problem solving teachers have to constantly do to figure out why a student isn’t learning. *What isn't clicking inside a student's mind? What errors are they making and why?*   Then to find a solution; sometimes multiple of them. What activities can I do for this student? *Sometimes I find one, sometimes I have to build one that caters perfectly to the student's need.* As if one student's mind wasn't complex enough, now multiply that process by 40 for the whole class. Group them together to make things efficient and productive. Boom, now I have a whole system or, one might say, a whole program on how to help these kids learn. Its not quite coding, but the logic, rigor, and reasoning is there.

Some have asked, “So do you want to leave teaching?” The honest answer is, I don’t know. But I do know I will be happy making a difference in the world (as cliché as that sounds) and feeling that I’ve reached my full potential to help people. As much as I love teaching and I’ve gotten pretty good at it, I can’t say I’ve done that. I have to be honest and admit, coding is really hard. Not sure if it’s just me, but it’s a COMPLETELY new language and one I find very difficult to learn. I feel dumb and I don’t like to feel dumb. But for some reason, there’s a drive in me to push through it all. I see Flatiron as a start and a window to helping me reach that full potential.
